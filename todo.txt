questions I have:

1. pull-up resistor on D+ to 5v, or 3.3v?
2. USB trace layout? Interference on ground plane?
3. oscillator layout?
4. analog trace for potentiometer layout? USB/8mhz oscillator interference?
5. 1M resistor on oscillator?
6. oscillator capacitor value/0403 size? other parameters I didn't consider?
7. 4.7k resistor on APX803S-29SA-7?
8. AMS1117 decoupling?

next steps:

1. export SMD assembly files in accordance with JLCPCB
2. add signature
3. add info
4. add board markings for no trash etc
5. add GameVision 50 logo
/6. create CubeMX project for pinout with labels
7. during which, manually follow every connection back to chip to ensure feasibilty for gpio/analog
8. check pinouts of headers and ensure they are accurate
